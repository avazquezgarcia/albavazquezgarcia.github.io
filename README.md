Hello! 

I am a PhD candidate at the [Paris School of Economics] (https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/) (PSE), supervised by [Antoine Bozio] (https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.com/bozio-antoine/fr/). 

My research focuses on public economics, using quasi-experimental methods and administrative datasets. I am interested in studying the taxation of capital and labour, understanding how individuals and firms respond to different policies.
